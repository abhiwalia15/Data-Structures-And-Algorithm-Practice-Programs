# Algorithm Sort by count problem


# In this algorithm i'll discuss the technique (SORT BY COUNT)

Sort(a,m)

{

------begin

for i<-1 to n do
	count[i]=1

for i<-1 to n-1 do
	-----begin

	for j<-i+1 to n do
		-----begin

		if(a[i] > a[j]) do
			count[i] = count[i]+1
		else
			count[j] = count[j]+1

		-----end for

	------end for


for i<-1 to n do
	b[count[i]] = a[i]

-----end function
